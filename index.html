<h2>The Lion and the Rabbit</h2>

<p>A <input type="text" name="cruel" size="6"> lion lived in the <input type="text" name="forest" size="6">. Every day, he <input type="text" name="killed" size="6"> and <input type="text" name="ate" size="3">a lot of annimals. 
The other <input type="text" name="animals" size="7"> were <input type="text" name="afraid" size="6"> the lion would kill them all.</p><br>

<p>The animals <input type="text" name="told" size="4"> the lion, "Let's make a deal. If you <input type="text" name="promise" size="7"> to eat only one animal each day, then one of us will come to you every day. Then you don't have to <input type="text" name="hunt" size="4"> and kill us."</p><br>

<p>The plan <input type="text" name="sounded" size="7"> well thought-out to the lion, so he <input type="text" name="agreed" size="6">, but he also said, "If you don't <input type="text" name="come" size="4"> every day, I promise to kill all of you the next day!".</p><br>

<p>Each day after that, one animal <input type="text" name="went" size="4"> to the lion so that the lion could eat it. Then, all the other animals were safe.</p><br>

<p>Finally, It was the rabbit's <input type="text" name="turn" size="4"> to go to the lion. 
The <input type="text" name="rabbit" size="6"> went very <input type="text" name="slowly" size="6"> that day. 
So the lion was <input type="text" name="angry" size="5"> when the rabbit <input type="text" name="finally" size="7"> arrived.</p><br>

<p>The lion angrily <input type="text" name="asked" size="5"> the rabbit, "Why are you late?"
"I was <input type="text" name="hidding" size="7"> from another lion in the forest. That lion said he was the <input type="text" name="king" size="4">, so I was afraid."</p><br>

<p>The lion told the rabbit, "I am the only king here! Take me to that other loin, and I will kill him."</p><br>

<p>The rabbit <input type="text" name="replied" size="7">, "I will be happy to show you where he lives."</p><br>

<p>The rabbit <input type="text" name="led" size="3"> the lion to an old well in the <input type="text" name="middle" size="6"> of the forest. 
The well was very deep with water at the <input type="text" name="bottom" size="6">. The rabbit told the lion, "Look in there. The lion lives at the bottom."</p><br>

<p>When the lion looked in the well, he could see his own face in the water. He thought that was the other lion. Without waiting another moment, 
the lion <input type="text" name="jumped" size="6"> into the well to <input type="text" name="attack" size="6"> the other lion. He never came out.</p><br>

<p> All of the other animals in the forest were very <input type="text" name="pleased" size="7"> with the rabbit's <input type="text" name="clever" size="6"> trick.</p><br>
